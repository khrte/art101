					<h2>Problems: </h2>
					<p> I had no issues with the numbered tasks, however I struggled a lot with task X.
						I ended up having to give up on X because it was getting too close to the lab deadline, but I did manage to get to a point where
					the output of the function would switch sides each time the button was pressed: however this would be undone when the button was pressed
				for a third time. I'm sure if I had the time to keep working on it I could figure this out, again though I just don't have the time. </p>

					<h2>Reflection:</h2>
					<p> Officially getting to the 'I'm lost' point of the quarter, but I'm having fun working out the problems. I really like that 
						theres a correct answer to code, its refreshing after taking so many humanaties and art classes.
