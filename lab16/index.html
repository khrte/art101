					<h2>Problems: </h2>
					<p> The API linked the the lab page did not seem to be working. I concluded this after visiting wes's own lab 16 page. 
						I decided to do what a classmate had also done, which was choose a new API to work with. (I chose the NASA Picture of the Day
						API.) 
						<br>
						The problem with this is that the NASA API does not have all the same functions as xkcd's does. To make up for this I wrote code
						that would function if it did and used '//' when writing it so it would not mess with my existing code.

					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This was a weird lab that made me decide I'm not a big fan of API's. I'm sure I could have fun with them in the future but 
						for now, if given the opportunity I will pass.
