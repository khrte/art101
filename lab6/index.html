					<p>Familiarize yourself with JavaScript objects and arrays</p>

					<h2>Problems: </h2>
					<p> While working with JavaScript I faced pretty minor issues. For instance I thought I might've defined MyTransport wrong 
						when calling it gave me an invalid response. I redefined it and only once I finished that did I realize I had just forgotted to 
						capitalize the M initially.
						Another time I decided to leave out the this in this.year, because I wasn't sure how needed it was in the function. I added it 
						quickly after finding that would not fly. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Pretty much all of my experience in coding is in Python, as I work with JavaScript I find I'm continuously 
						running into familiar terms like arrays and script. I think its interesting learning about these terms in 
						JavaScript and finding out just exactly what the differences are between the two languages. 
						It makes me want to learn more about code!
