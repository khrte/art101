			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge: </h2>
					<p>Write a function that gets user input and outputs their input sorted.</p>
					
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems: </h2>
					<p> My first problem with the function was that my output was not showing up on the Lab page. I found out, by asking for WesBots help
						that I should have been using .isLowerCase instead of .isLower. 
						For a while the function was prompting the user for an input twice. I found out this was because earlier in the code it was asking for js script. 
						Initially I did not notice this because it was apart of the html template. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection: </h2>
					<p> Before we started working on Labs, I mentioned on the discord that I had basic experience with Python Code. Wes responded 
						and told me that that experience would help me a lot in the class. 
						At the time I wasn't sure what they meant, as I knew we were dealing a lot with HTML later in the class. However coding in JavaScript has 
						finally led me to connect those dots. 
						As I worked on this lab, like I had in the last few labs, I realized how similar the languages could be. 
						I mean, its been a while since I've taken a python class, but if I remember correctly sorting out input in python is almost identical to how it is done in 
						JavaScript. I am delighted to realize this! Huzzah!
