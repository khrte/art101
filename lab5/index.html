					<h2>Challenge: </h2>
					<p>Further our understanding of Javascript variables and data types</p>

					<h2>Problems: </h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them?</p>
					<p>I'm not familiar with Javascript, so I asked for Wesbots help. 
						I could not figure out how to set a boolean value, and when I asked for help from Wesbot 
						I forgot to specify I was using Javascript, as I was not aware there was a difference between Java and Javascript.
						As you can see in the below screenshot, this led to a lot of errors. 
						Eventually Wesbot realized I was referring to Javascript, and all was solved.

					<h2>Reflection: </h2>
			
						<p> 	I decided to kill two birds with one stone by using WesBot (extra credit assignment) while completing Lab 5. 
							I've never been asked by a professor before to use AI, safe to say it was a strange feeling. 
							Throughout the whole experience I felt like I was cheating. If you asked me how I was exactly, I'm not sure I could tell you.
							Especially because had the answers not come from WesBot, they would have come from Google. WesBot was just easier because 
							instead of typing 30 different things into a search bar to get my answer, I could tell WesBot it wasn't giving me the right info. 
							I suppose the feeling just comes from a mixture of: 'this is new and I'm weird about it', 'I don't like AI for X and X and X' and 
							'Oh god no professor has ever let me use AI before what am I doing.'
