                        Remember the Distinguished Innovators competition?
                        [Viktor] I remember you notching gears
                        in the carriage over.
                        [J] They started cranking the engine and 
                        the whole thing was rattling. I thought a loose cog
                        was gonna take someone's eye out.
                        [V] At least, you didn't throw up.
                        [J] Everything made sense then. 
                        [V] You have to destroy it. 
                        [J] I know.
                        [Viktor] The Hexcore.
                        Iâ€¦ I can't do it.
                        You have to. Please.
                        Promise me.
                        [Jayce] Okay. Okay.
                        I promise.
                        [Viktor] We lost ourselves. Lost our dream.
                        In the pursuit of great,
                        we failed to do good.
