					<h2>Problems: </h2>
					<p> I went back to work on lab 12. At the time my issue was with task X, I was trying to match the title
						of each class with a unique color and description but they were always mismatched. 
						I found out I was still using the code for the past tasks for class name, while using a new code to get
						class color and class description. 
						I matched the code, and it worked. Huzzah!  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Its amazing how easy it is to notice the mistakes you made at midnight when its ten in the morning. 
						Its also easy to get confused looking at those mistakes because you clearly were just copy and pasting code 
						without any understanding of what you were doing. 
						The hardest part about this assignment was figuring out what I was looking at in my past assignments.
