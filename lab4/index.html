			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge:</h2>
					<p>Establish a better understanding of pseudocode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? 
						I was a bit confused working with the template, given it was the first time I was lost during a Lab and we were working with a new 
						type of code, I'm blaming Java. 
						I refrenced Wes's own website a lot in hopes of figuring out the assignment, and believe what I have is correct.
						
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection:</h2>
					<p> I was pretty confused working with Java because its so new to me, but in terms of HTML and CSS: I'm getting better at formatting. 
						When I first inserted the pseudocode into my Lab 4 page,  it wouldn't fit inside it's box, but I managed to fix 
						that problem quicker than I ever have before! Huzzah. 
					</p>

					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<div class="code">
						<p>Pseudocode I made:</p>
						<pre>
							<code>
// shuffle card deck 
// deal cards
	// increase face down cards by one for seven slots, starting at zero
		// place one face up card in each of the seven slots 
		// establish four empty slots above seven slots, set values to 0 and ensure there is a different suite for every slot
// prioritize placing cards in four above slots, then slots with less hidden cards
// draw one card from deck
	// if drawn card is one place higher and the same suite as a card in an empty slot:
		// if card is the opposite color and one value lower than a face up card:
			// place drawn card on top card. 
	// else: 
		// draw again
// if no cards left in deck: 
	// reshuffle cards
// if no cards hidden or in deck: 
	// declare victory
							</code>
