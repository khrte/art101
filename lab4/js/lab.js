  // Increase face down cards by one for seven slots, starting at zero
      //Place one face up card in each of the seven slots 
      // Establish four empty slots above seven slots, set values to 0 and ensure there is a different suite for every slot.
// Draw one card from deck
  // If drawn card is one place higher and the same suite as a card in an empty slot, place card in slot.
    // If card is the opposite color and one value lower than a face up card, place drawn card on top card. 
    //Prioritize placing cards in four above slots, then slots with less hidden cards.
  // else: draw again.
  //If no cards left in deck: reshuffle
// if no cards hidden or in deck: win.
