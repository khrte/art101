					<h2>Challenge: </h2>

					<p>Experiment with Loops</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems: </h2>
					<p> I put OneLongString within the loop, took me a while to figure out why it was only printing when i = 1.
						I also made the mistake of not following the instructions for how to write the function, and just tried writing it how I thought it would work.
						Things got a lot easier once I started referencing the lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection: </h2>
					<p> Things are getting more difficult, this may be a pattern with code related classes because I distinctly remember putting a CS class on the backburner last year 
						because of how easy I found it, then paying the price later. Oops? It's not that bad yet though. (knock on wood)<br>
						Anyway, had a moment where I got very nervous because I could not figure out how to make the lab work then, as mentioned in the problem section above, I started
						following directios and things got a lot easier.
